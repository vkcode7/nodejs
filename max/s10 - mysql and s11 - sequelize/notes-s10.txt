This section is combined 10 and 11 that deals with MySQL integration

Section 10 changes are in utils/database.js, controllers/admin and controller/shop

SQL vs No SQL

SQL has Tables, NoSQL has collections
Tables have records, collections have docs
NoSQL can have redundant data in collections for performance reasons
NoSQL has no strong data schema

SQL has
- data schemas
- relations
- multiple Tables
- horizontal scaling is difficut as same DB cant be on multiple boxes
- limited read and writes per seconds (thousands)

NoSQL is
- schemaless
- data is segregated into few collections
- typically data is nested or merged in a few collections
- both Horiz and Vert scaling is possible
- great performance for mass read and wrire requests

MySQL Installation on MacOS:

scroll to community downloads - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

We need to install MySQL Community Server and Workbench, 
use Legacy Password authentication durimng setup steps.

connection pool for multiple queries to be run

Squelize - 3rd party library that behind the scenes that map the javascript objects to SQL and 
does all the heavy lifting so we dont have to write SQL code on our own.

Seuelize is an Object Relational Mapping library and needs mysql2 package.

Sequelize uses models to create objects, save and find them, much like entity framework in .NET.

If you are good with mysql queries or if you want know what is going under the hood 
than please go with mysql. Also if your project is complex and there will be thousands 
of hits everyday then it will be a better option to proceed with mysql. 
And if you are new to it and dont want to learn deeply it or your project is not complex 
then please proceed with sequelize.

since I am not interested in learning details of sequelize, I skipped 158 to 174.
